The goal of the project; to create a turret that can be remotely controlled in line with the objectives such as ensuring life safety in military areas, gaining superiority against terrorist threats, benefiting domestic production and keeping up with the developing technology. Necessary circuits will be installed on the turret, the 3D mold of which is printed, and the movement will be carried out to lock the turret to the target through the user via computer or mobile, and this information will be sent to the turret via the wireless communication module HC-05 and its shot will be provided. In the project, servo motors are moved by the user's computer mouse or telephone touch screen and this movement is controlled by Arduino NANO microcontroller. Here the Arduino platform is used to control everything.
